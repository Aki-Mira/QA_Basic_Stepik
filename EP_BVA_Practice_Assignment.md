# DECRIPTION: 
- This page contains a simple specification for Equivalence Partitioning and Boundary Value Analysis test design techniques, along with several different implementations of this specification. Implementation 1 is correct, others - not so much. Your goal is to find ON, OFF, OUT, IN other values that will find bugs in all of them.

## Specification
- Any integer that is greater or equal to -10,000 and less or equal to 10,000 is accepted by the program;
- All negative integers must be stored in a database with other negative integers;
- All positive integers must be stored in a database with other positive integers;
- Zero should not be stored.
